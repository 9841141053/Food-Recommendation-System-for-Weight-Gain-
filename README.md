# Food-Recommendation-System-for-Weight-Gain-
Design a Food Recommendation system ysing Fuzzy Inference system 
In this study of food recommendation offers a collection of diet plan and employs the fuzzy logic to predict the output of 	weight gain to benefit researchers in this field. Food recommendation aims to provide a list of ranked food items for users to meet their personalized needs. Fuzzy logic has been extensively used in the design of a recommender system to handle the uncertainty, impreciseness and vagueness in item features and user's lifestyle.  Fuzzy logic is mainly valued logic in which there are various input and output along with the member function. The work will propose a fuzzy logic technique which shows accurately the weight gain of the individual on following the diet plan for a particular duration.
